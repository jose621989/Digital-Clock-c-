# Digital-Clock-c-
displays BOTH 12- and 24-hour time formats on the interface at the same time.
// The problem that this project was trying to solve was to provide a simple and easy-to-use tool for displaying the current time.

One thing that you may have done particularly well in this project is using the time and localtime functions from the ctime library to get the current time and convert it to a tm struct. These functions are widely used and reliable, and they make it easy to get the current time in a convenient and usable format.

There are a few areas where I could potentially enhance my code to make it more efficient, secure, and maintainable. For example, I could consider adding error handling and validation to my code to ensure that it is robust and handles unexpected input. I could also consider adding more features to the clock, such as the ability to set alarms or customize the display format.

One piece of the code that I found challenging to write was the logic for displaying the time in 12-hour format. In order to display the time in 12-hour format, I needed to convert the hour from 24-hour format to 12-hour format, and then display "AM" or "PM" based on the value of the hour. To overcome this challenge, I used an if-else statement to check the value of the hour and determine whether to display "AM" or "PM".

To make my code more maintainable, readable, and adaptable, I used good coding practices such as using descriptive and consistent naming conventions, writing clear and concise code, and commenting my code to provide context and explain my thought process. I also used tools such as code formatting and linting to help ensure that my code follows best practices and is easy to read and understand.

Some skills that I developed or strengthened while working on this project include problem-solving, critical thinking, and the ability to work with time and date data. These skills are likely to be transferable to other projects or coursework, as they are useful in many different contexts.
